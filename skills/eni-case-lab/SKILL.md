# Cold Coffee Case Lab

Create a clean, repeatable case before complex analysis.

## Start

1. Run `scripts/new_case.py <name> --root <directory>` to create a case workspace.
2. Put untouched inputs under `artifacts/original/`.
3. Run `scripts/hash_artifact.py <path> --manifest <case>/manifest.json` for each input.
4. Keep derived files under `work/`, scripts under `scripts/`, evidence under `evidence/`, and final outputs under `output/`.

## Select references

- Case lifecycle, commands, snapshots, local services: read `references/case-workflow.md`.
- Evidence, hashes, timestamps, logs, PCAP, dumps, and reporting: read `references/evidence.md`.

## Execute

- Record tool versions, exact commands, environment, timestamps, and output paths.
- Prefer deterministic scripts and configuration over manual-only steps.
- Track assumptions and failed hypotheses in `notes.md`.
- Keep service ports/processes and cleanup commands in the case manifest.

## Deliver

Package the manifest, scripts, evidence index, key artifacts, results, verification commands, and cleanup instructions.
