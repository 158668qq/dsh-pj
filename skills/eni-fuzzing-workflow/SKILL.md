# Fuzzing Workflow

Define the parser or API boundary. Build a deterministic harness, tiny valid seed corpus, dictionary, sanitizer build, and time budget. Run campaigns, minimize crashes, deduplicate root causes, reproduce under a debugger, and convert confirmed crashes into regression tests.

Persist checkpoints before long runs. Record commands, versions, hashes, evidence paths, assumptions, and verification results. Chain through eni-universal-workflow and finish with delivery.
